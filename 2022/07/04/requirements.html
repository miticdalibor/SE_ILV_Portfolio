<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

<p>Folgende Requirements wurden nach den SOPHISTEN Regeln für Frunch Infinity 2.0 definiert:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Functional:
    <ul>
      <li>When the Turbofan dataset is imported within the Streamlit app, the application must fully recognize all variables and values of the dataset</li>
      <li>When the user accesses the application, a choice of available datasets is presented on the user interface</li>
      <li>If a selection of different datasets is provided in the app, the corresponding dataset must be imported in the data folder of the Frunch      Infinity Gitlab repository</li>
      <li>When the user runs the “Free Lunch” function (Auto Machine Learning process) within the application, the pipeline must be able to prepare the selected dataset for model training</li>
      <li>When the selected dataset is passed to the pipeline, the pipeline has to be able to remove missing values</li>
      <li>When the selected dataset is passed to the pipeline, the pipeline must be capable of scaling the relevant features</li>
      <li>Once the pipeline has preprocessed the selected data set, several statistical models should be trained on the data to make the training results comparable</li>
      <li>When the training of the models is completed, a table with the model results must be displayed within the user interface</li>
      <li>If errors occur while running the Frunch function, the errors should be visible on the app’s interface to facilitate the debugging for app-developers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technological</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quality of Service</p>
  </li>
  <li>User Interface:
    <ul>
      <li>If the user starts the app, they have to be able to select a data set from an available list.</li>
      <li>When the models finish the training a summary table must be created showing all results of the models.</li>
      <li>When the user is starting the free lunch function and any errors occur from the code, those erros should be displayed via the app to the user for debugging.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Requirements related to other results</p>
  </li>
  <li>Requirements for activities</li>
</ul>
